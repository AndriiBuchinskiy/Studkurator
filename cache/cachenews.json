Toss potatoes, lemons, oregano, and \u00c2\u00bd cup oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer and roast, tossing halfway through, until potatoes are golden brown, tender, and crisp in spots, and lemons are golden brown, 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c35 minutes.\r\n\r\n    Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on 1 side of grill; for a gas grill, leave 1 or 2 burners off). Alternatively, heat a grill pan over medium-high. Brush naan with \u00c2\u00bc cup oil total. Working in batches if needed, grill over direct heat until underside is lightly charred, about 1 minute. Turn and grill until second side has a few light grill marks, about 30 seconds. Transfer charred side up to a baking sheet and let cool slightly.\r\n\r\n    Arrange roasted potatoes and lemons over charred side of naan. Top with rosemary leaves, then dot with burrata and season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n    Place naan over indirect heat, cover grill, and grill until cheese is warmed through and crust is crisp, 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 minutes. If using a grill pan, transfer naan to a 450\u00c2\u00b0 oven and bake 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 minutes. Transfer to a surface and drizzle with more oil.","image":"images\/FLATBREAD-3-of-3.jpg","intro":"Grilled Naan with Burrata and Roasted Potato and Lemon","published":"1","date":"2018-05-20 13:55:08"},{"id":"4","author_id":"6","text":"Ingredients:\r\n\r\n    2 garlic cloves, finely grated\r\n    \u00c2\u00bc cup tomato paste\r\n    \u00c2\u00be teaspoon ground cinnamon\r\n    \u00c2\u00be teaspoon ground cumin\r\n    \u00c2\u00be teaspoon smoked paprika\r\n    \u00c2\u00be teaspoon kosher salt, plus more\r\n    12 ounces ground lamb\r\n    All-purpose flour (for dusting)\r\n    8 ounces prepared pizza dough, cut in half, room temperature\r\n    2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling\r\n    \u00c2\u00bd small red onion, thinly sliced\r\n    1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems\r\n    1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\r\n    Crushed red pepper flakes (for serving)\r\n\r\nRecipe Preparation:\r\n\r\n    Place a baking sheet on a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 500\u00c2\u00b0.
